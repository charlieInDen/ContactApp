# ContactApp

 IOS Contact App  
Disclaimer/FYI:   
- Using Realm, much more intuitive than Core Data   
- Listed down improvements that can be made to the code below   
- Can't implement everything I wanted to implement all test cases but due to other work, will do later   
- Focused test on functionality of infra instead of UI  
 - Long but extensive mini project, I enjoyed it alot    
Assumptions:   
- Ordered contact list alphabetically by Name (First is prioritized), but above all favorite contacts of each section are shown first (also alphabetically ordered)  
Improvements:   
- Dedicated logging and funneling of all Realm getters and writes   
- UITest on each functionality flow (i.e Changing a phone number, calling a contact, editing an image)   
- Update data on server by sending post request on editing contact
